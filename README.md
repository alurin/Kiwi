Kiwi 0.2 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/alurin/kiwi.png)](http://travis-ci.org/alurin/kiwi)
==========================================================================================================

Description
-----------
My hobby. Experemental language used capabilities of parsing generators by
Bison & Flex, code generation by LLVM and unicode support by ICU.

Feel free submit patches and issues. Who knows, maybe in feature...

My current goals
----------------
* Static OOP language with support of extendable object (e.g. simple adding method and field in runtime)
* Multi inheritance:
    * Objects as methods and field sets (parent class included only one)
    * Interfaces as abstract classes
* Method and fields aliasing, renaming and merging
* Properties
* Integration from user-land to language level:
    * Events
    * Dependence injection
    * Plugins

* Direction for application, but not for beginer developers
* Not simple, not hard.

**WARNING**
-----------
This is EXPEREMENTAL and is not known whether it's be complete for PRODUCTION.
Tested and development in Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit.

Prerequisites
-------------
This project requires:
* Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.8+
* GNU Make or equivalent.
* GCC 4.6 or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
* Boost C++ Libraries v1.37+ (v1.46 recomended) [HEADERS and LIBRARIES]
* LLVM 3.1
* ICU 4.4+

Building
--------
This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
the typical build invocation of `./configure` followed by `make` will work.
For a list of all possible build targets, use the command `make help`.

NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

Installing
----------
Once the project has been built (see "Building"), execute `sudo make install`.
